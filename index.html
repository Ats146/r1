    <h1>Experience on Str-Ai-Ver</h1>
    <p>During the orientation of smps this very smp caught my attention , because it sounded very interesting. and only by 2 classes i have quite already learnt a lot , basics of html and css and even java script. The sessions are also interactive and interesting. 
        also dsa which i have been keeping aside for a long time now , i have started doing it because of the inspo i have gotten from the sessions. i am very excited and looking forward towards all the sessions.
        and sincerely thanking all the seniors who have put so much efforts into teaching us , Thank you very much .
